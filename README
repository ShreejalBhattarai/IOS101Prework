Some of my favourite IOS apps contain Forest(The smooth Animations), Clock(Icons and UI), Instagram(Vibrant Colors), Maps(Animation) and Twitter(Font).

I’m thinking of making an app that changes the screen’s color and plays a matching sound based on the user’s mood. The user can choose how they’re feeling,
and the app will generate a color and sound that fits. I also want to let users save their favorite mood combinations and maybe share them with friends.
